# nice things about pyproject.toml
# - zip_safe=False isn't necessary anymore
# - correctly discovers namespace packages by defuilt?
# - correctly handles py.typed by default?
# - handles src layout automatically https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#src-layout

# things I'm not sure about yet
# - avoiding duplication/variable reuse?
# - file/git dependencies?
# - unclear how to specify namespace package order https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/reorder_editable/issues/2

# TODO
# - maybe it has a nicer pypi upload system? not sure
#   e.g. possibly use hatch/flit/pdb/poetry -- but not sure what's the benefit tbh
